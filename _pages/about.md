Introduction
======
I am Dhiren Oswal, pursuing Master's of Science in Computer Science at University of Southern California. I graduated from Vishwakarma Institute of Information Technology, Pune with a Bachelor's in Technology - Artificial Intelligence and Data Science. I have been grateful to research under the guidance of [Dr. Parikshit Mahalle](https://parikshitmahalle.com/) in the verticals of Deep learning and Generative AI aplication for Medical Imaging. Auto-generate Patient-Specififc Cranial Implants [Vid](https://bit.ly/Auto-Implant-Vid) focuses on Data collection, and modulation of Sparse Deep Nets and Generative Adverserial Networks to auto design implants for cranioplasty. The focus of project lies in reducing the time and cost overhead. 

Research Interests
======
with projects spanning across ML DL applications in Computer Vision, and Natural Language Processing I am interested in researching 
1. maximizing information extraction from minimal behavorial data and find human coginition basis. 
2. Developing optimized Deep Learning/Machine Learning systems which can be deployed with minimal resources in places of criticality like Operation Rooms.  

Development
======
I also have experience in Software dvelopment cycles with Designing, Developing and deploying skills. Sample of Web Design works include [Mealawe App Prototype](https://www.figma.com/proto/XJcrWO7fXjgvwUcdWcwt0D/Mealawe?node-id=211-28755&t=S0KMF4Optlvu7PYZ-1&starting-point-node-id=211%3A28755), [PointSix App Prototype](https://www.figma.com/proto/uEgPJQoWnIVcWbQ9f3NZL2/pointSix?node-id=780-15117&t=E9nXajXgW5btIVEX-1&starting-point-node-id=780%3A15087), [Orbiz Group Web App](https://orbizgroup.com/), [Bookcrunch website](https://bookcrunch.in/).
