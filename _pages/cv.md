Education
======
* M.S. in Computer Science, University of Southern California, 2024-2026
* B.S. in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science, Vishwakarma Institute of Information Technology, 2020-2024 (now [VIT](https://vit.edu) )

Work experience
======
* Research Assistant: VISHWAKARMA INSTITUTE OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY
  * Advisor: [Parikshit Mahalle [Ph.D.]](https://parikshitmahalle.com/),
  * Conducting advanced research in the intersection of Generative AI and Computer Vision for the automation of Cranial Implant Design to shorten the time and cost overhead of designing Patient-Specific Implants
  * Calibrated a novel dataset of 930+ augmented samples as a baseline to test AI models
  * Tested the reconstruction abilities of a Generative Adversarial Net [GAN] and a Sparse Tensor based CNN using Nvidia A100 GPU. The GAN increased the dice score to 92% while the Tensors enabled CNN induce sparsity to accelerate the computations and enhance robustness by reducing GPU-RAM usage from 40 GB to 6 GB

* UX Architect Intern: HTS TECH SOLUTION
  * Designed the wireframe-enabled architecture and data pipeline maps for end-to-end modules like lead management, inventory management, and ledger management for a large Real Estate development firm
  * Integrated a Key Performance index Layer to monitor progress in various domains for the client with an improvement in System Usability Score by 13% and Task Success Rate by 32%

Projects
======
* NEET-QA
  * Accepted at [ICAAIML](https://icaaiml.com/elementor-1155/),
  * Implemented a distinctive application of RAG-based Question Answering System in the NEET (Indian Medical Entrance) exam using Langchain for Gemini-Pro, GPT-3.5-turbo-0125 LLMs with custom retrieval methods
  * Boosted answer accuracy by 12.5% on average against simple LLMs in Physics, Chemistry, and Biology MCQ answering, with the highest increment of 20.1% in the Biology domain. Work includes analysis of the generated answers and provides crucial checkpoints in advancing the RAG systems

* VOLUMETRIC IMAGES OF PATIENT-SPECIFIC IMPLANTS FOR CRANIAL DEFECTS
  * Data Set Published at [Mendeley, Data Commons](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/ywnjr7gnty/1),
